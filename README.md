## Description

At the very first stage, we would like you to do ​a task which is described below. Send us the solution back within the next 7​ days.
Please commit your code to a public git repository (e.g. GitLab) and share a link with us so we can review it :) Please name your repository as 'Node Task CR'

This is a sample API that contains CRUD operations for pets domain. Unfortunately it is not perfect. What we want from you is to perform a code review, discover
any potential issues that can impact performance, bugs or code smells which you consider appropriate and then refactor it.

For example in one place in the code we use `==` equality comparison where the best practice is to use `===`, but there should be more to discover.

The API uses Nest API framework and a documentation can be found here https://docs.nestjs.com/

## Running the app

You can application locally using Docker Compose

```bash
docker-compose up
```

In case of any questions regarding the task don't hesitate to ask us.
